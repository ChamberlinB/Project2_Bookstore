Project 2: Preprocessed CSS (SCSS)
Project 2 is an introduction to SCSS.  The goal of this assignment is to focus on the syntax and usage of SCSS.  I have provided content and a layout to allow time to focus on the SCSS.  Here a link to the PDF of the required layout and content.  Please update the headers and images in the content to match the theme of your choice: DGM2780-Proj2.pdf Preview the documentView in a new window

Your assignment is to recreate the layout in the PDF using SCSS only.  You must utilize all of the main topics in the Sass Basics guide found here:   (Links to an external site.)http://sass-lang.com/guide (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)

You are not required to use Koala App for your preprocessing but I highly recommend it.  You can get the free app on mac or windows here (Links to an external site.) and learn how to get started here (Links to an external site.).

Each item in the rubric is directly associated with the Sass Basics guide.  This is an introduction to SCSS so I expect you to read everything thoroughly.  The project must be uploaded to a website and submitted as a URL to canvas or you will receive a grade of 0.

This is the starter file I mentioned in class:  Download HereView in a new window

 Note that the starter file has partials and pages set up.  You can change those to anything you want.  They are just an example.  Please upload your starter file (after it is completed) to this assignment in canvas in addition to the URL for your site.
